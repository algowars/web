 * Strategy registry: one entry per game mode. Partial<> because a mode's

 * falls back gracefully when a key isn't registered.
 *
 * The actual "solve problems that get harder as you go" gameplay
 * (RampWorkspace/RampWorkspaceHeader/RampGameOverSummary, under ./ramp) is
 * shared: every mode's strategy calls into it rather than owning its own
 * copy, since one player's loop is identical whether they're alone (Solo
 * Rush) or one of several participants racing on their own independent
 * problem track (Duel, FFA). Duel/FFA's strategy additionally composes the
 * lobby phase (./lobby) in front of it, since those modes wait for players
 * before starting — Solo Rush skips straight to Ramp*.
 *
 * To add a new mode that reuses the same gameplay: register Ramp* directly
 * (like Solo Rush), or wrap it the way Duel/FFA do if the mode needs its own
 * pre-game phase. A mode with genuinely different gameplay gets its own
 * strategy instead. PlayGameContent never needs to change either way.
